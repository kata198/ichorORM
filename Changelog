1.0.2 - May 31 2018
-------------------

* Fix a case where string "NULL" could be interpreted as literal NULL (None)

* Support using a native list/tuple in a conditional with "in" or "not in"

* Fixup the support for an "in" or "not in" conditional with a string-list using parameterized queries. Quotes are now properly handled.


1.0.1 - May 31 2018
-------------------
* With something like DatabaseModel.filter(fieldName=None) this would formerly generate a query like "fieldName = NULL" which is always False. fieldName__is=None would translate to the proper "fieldName is NULL" and fieldName__isnot=None to "fieldName is not NULL".

  Simplify/unify so that when the value is .filter is None or constants.SQL_NULL, we automatically convert 'eq' and 'ne' to 'is' and 'is not'

* Small optimization: use LIMIT 1 when doing DatabaseModel.get(primaryKey)
